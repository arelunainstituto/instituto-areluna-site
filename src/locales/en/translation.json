                    "answer": "FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) is the most advanced hair transplant technique. We extract individual follicles from the donor area with 0.8-1.0mm micro-punches, preserving surrounding tissues. Then we implant each follicle in the recipient area with precision, ensuring natural results and rapid healing."

                    "answer": "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you will not feel pain during surgery. There may be some minimal discomfort in the first 2-3 days, easily controlled with medication. Most patients find the post-operative period much more comfortable than they expected."

                    "question": "How many sessions are necessary?",

                    "question": "Is hair transplant permanent?",
                    "answer": "Yes, hair transplant is permanent. The transplanted follicles are taken from the donor area (nape/sides) which genetically do not suffer from baldness. Therefore, the transplanted hair maintains these characteristics and will not fall out over a lifetime."

                "recovery": {
                    "question": "What is the recovery time?",
                    "answer": "You can resume normal activities in 2-3 days. Work can be resumed after 3-5 days, depending on the activity. Intense physical exercise should be avoided for 2 weeks. The small scabs fall off naturally in 7-10 days. We follow strict post-operative monitoring."

                    "question": "Can I have a transplant if I have little donor hair?",
                    "answer": "We evaluate each case individually. Even with limited donor area, it is often possible to achieve excellent results by focusing on the most important areas (front line). We use density maximization techniques and, if necessary, suggest complementary treatments."

                "natural_look": {
                    "question": "Does the result look natural?",
                    "answer": "Yes, with the FUE technique and our 25 years of experience, the results are completely natural. We respect the natural growth pattern, the direction of the hairs, and the front line appropriate to age. No one will be able to distinguish transplanted hair from natural hair."
